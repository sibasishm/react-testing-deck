# What We are Told vs What We Do

‚ö†Ô∏è The goal: Ship with confidence, not follow dogma.

| Conventional Wisdom                       | The Reality                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Test Driven Development                   | "We wrote it after 3 prod bugs"          |
| 100% Coverage                             | "We test the scary stuff first"          |
| Pure Functions = Unit Tests = Good Design | "The test broke, but the feature worked" |

# What Makes a Test Worth It?

‚ùå Tests that:

- Know too much about the internals
- Break because of renames or DOM changes
- Exist ‚Äújust for coverage‚Äù

‚úÖ Tests that:

- Mirror real user behavior
- Are resilient to internal refactors
- Save you from introducing regressions
- Guide better component/API design

# Testing Philosophy in Practice

> ‚ÄúThe more your tests resemble how your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.‚Äù

- Kent C. Dodds

> ‚ÄúFocus on testing what Redux-connected components render and do ‚Äî not their internals.‚Äù

- Mark Erikson

<br/>
<br/>

So we:

- Avoid testing Redux logic in isolation
- Use `renderWithProviders` and `MSW`
- Write tests after the component is useful, not before

# How We Test Our Components

Live coding and examples

---

# When (Not) to Test

üí° Think Cost vs Benefit and Test code you want to protect.

High ROI:

- Core flows: login, checkout, dashboard
- Bug regressions
- Anything you‚Äôre scared to change

Low ROI:

- Pure CSS/layout tweaks
- Very early prototype UIs
- Internals you plan to delete soon

---

# What We Gained

üí° Testing = documentation + confidence + courage

‚úÖ Fewer regressions in business-critical flows

‚úÖ Ability to refactor with confidence

‚úÖ Cleaner APIs (because tests exposed bad ones)

‚úÖ Onboarding is faster ‚Äî tests show usage clearly

<!--
Your Next Steps
Pick a flow you're scared to touch ‚Äî write a test for it

Start with one meaningful integration test

Invest in renderWithProviders or setup() utils

Share flaky tests with the team ‚Äî kill them together
